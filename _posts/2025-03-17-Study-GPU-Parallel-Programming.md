These three things are what you need to fully understand as follows:

 
(1) CUDA Programming
(2) Understanding Compiler Optimization Areas
(3) Parallel Computing
 

As for (1) CUDA Programming, NVIDIA provides the best materials as follows:

https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/index.html
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html
https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples
https://github.com/NVIDIA/CUDALibrarySamples

As for (2) Understanding Compiler Optimization Areas, the best thing to do is to read lots of papers.

Roofline Paper is what you need to look at first.

You need to present the paper. However, please do not summarize it (do not skip any paragraph).

You must explain everything in the paper per each paragraph. 

This link might help you to understand the paper--- https://docs.nersc.gov/tools/performance/roofline/

This paper presents one of the basic in HPC.


As for (3) Parallel Computing, “Introduction to Parallel Computing” by Ananth Grama.

In 3 months, the goal is to understand the above three things perfectly.
